# Fuji.me! — Development Journal

## Architecture Overview

```
Phase 1 — Launch:
  Static site (Astro + React islands)
  -> Data compiled to static HTML at build time
  -> Interactive tables hydrated as React islands
  -> Deployed to GitHub Pages
  -> Affiliate links are plain <a> tags with tracking params

Phase 2 — Scoring:
  Same static site
  -> Complete genre scoring (remaining 6 genres)
  -> Systematic MTF review

Phase 3 — Revenue diversification:
  Same static site + Gumroad (merch) + Buttondown (newsletter)
  -> Sponsored placements, high-commission affiliates, newsletter sponsorship
  -> No backend needed

Phase 4 — Multi-system (if phase 3 gate passes):
  Same architecture, more data files (Sony E, Nikon Z, Canon RF)
```


## Migration from Prototype

The prototype is a single 3400-line JSX file with inline styles and embedded data.

| Step | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | TypeScript interfaces for all data types | Done |
| 2 | Extract lens data into `src/data/lenses.ts` | Done — 242 lenses |
| 3 | Extract camera data into `src/data/cameras.ts` | Done — 39 bodies, 46 fields |
| 4 | Scaffold Astro + React islands | Pending (#57) |
| 5 | Extract wiki, accessories data | Done — accessories migrated, wiki pending (#4) |
| 6 | Split into Astro pages + React islands | Pending |
| 7 | Replace inline styles with Astro scoped styles + CSS Modules | Pending |
| 8 | Add affiliate link data and Trade Deals integration | Pending |
| 9 | Deploy to GitHub Pages with custom domain (CNAME) | Pending |

### Field renames (prototype to production)

| Prototype | Production | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `type: "P" \| "Z"` | `type: "prime" \| "zoom"` | Self-documenting |
| `format` | `mount` | Correct term for lens compatibility |
| `flMin` / `flMax` | `focalLengthMin` / `focalLengthMax` | Readable without comment |
| `ap` | `maxAperture` | Unambiguous |
| `mtf` | Split into `sweetSpotSharpness`, `wideOpenSharpness`, `cornerSharpness`, `astigmatism`, `fieldCurvature`, `comaRating` | Single number replaced by individual MTF-sourced readings |
| `lm` | `afMotor` | Three tiers: DC, STM, LM instead of boolean |
| `wr` | `isWeatherSealed` | Standard industry term |
| `kg` | `weight` | Grams for both Lens and Camera; no unit in name |
| `thread` | `filterThread` | Distinguishes from mechanical threads |
| `est` | `priceEstimated` | Readable as boolean (later removed — all prices are estimates) |
| `af` (optional) | `hasAutofocus` (required) | Default false for MF lenses |
