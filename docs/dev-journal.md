# Fuji.me! — Development Journal

## Architecture Overview

```
Phase 1 — Launch:
  Static site (Astro + React islands)
  -> Data compiled to static HTML at build time
  -> Interactive tables hydrated as React islands
  -> Deployed to GitHub Pages
  -> Affiliate links are plain <a> tags with tracking params

Phase 2 — Scoring:
  Same static site
  -> Complete genre scoring (remaining 6 genres)
  -> Systematic MTF review

Phase 3 — Revenue diversification:
  Same static site + Gumroad (merch) + Buttondown (newsletter)
  -> Sponsored placements, high-commission affiliates, newsletter sponsorship
  -> No backend needed

Phase 4 — Multi-system (if phase 3 gate passes):
  Same architecture, more data files (Sony E, Nikon Z, Canon RF)
```


## Migration from Prototype

The prototype is a single 3400-line JSX file with inline styles and embedded data.

| Step | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | TypeScript interfaces for all data types | Done |
| 2 | Extract lens data into `src/data/lenses.ts` | Done — 242 lenses |
| 3 | Extract camera data into `src/data/cameras.ts` | Done — 39 bodies, 46 fields |
| 4 | Scaffold Astro + React islands | Pending (#57) |
| 5 | Extract wiki, accessories data | Done — accessories migrated, wiki pending (#4) |
| 6 | Split into Astro pages + React islands | Pending |
| 7 | Replace inline styles with Astro scoped styles + CSS Modules | Pending |
| 8 | Add affiliate link data and Trade Deals integration | Pending |
| 9 | Deploy to GitHub Pages with custom domain (CNAME) | Pending |

### Field renames (prototype to production)

| Prototype | Production | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `type: "P" \| "Z"` | `type: "prime" \| "zoom"` | Self-documenting |
| `format` | `mount` | Correct term for lens compatibility |
| `flMin` / `flMax` | `focalLengthMin` / `focalLengthMax` | Readable without comment |
| `ap` | `maxAperture` | Unambiguous |
| `mtf` | Split into `sweetSpotSharpness`, `wideOpenSharpness`, `cornerSharpness`, `astigmatism`, `fieldCurvature`, `comaRating` | Single number replaced by individual MTF-sourced readings |
| `lm` | `afMotor` | Three tiers: DC, STM, LM instead of boolean |
| `wr` | `isWeatherSealed` | Standard industry term |
| `kg` | `weight` | Grams for both Lens and Camera; no unit in name |
| `thread` | `filterThread` | Distinguishes from mechanical threads |
| `est` | `priceEstimated` | Readable as boolean (later removed — all prices are estimates) |
| `af` (optional) | `hasAutofocus` (required) | Default false for MF lenses |

### Session 9 — 2026-04-11

Tool: Claude Code (Opus 4.6)

**Genre scoring engine + data model review**

Genre guide implementation:
- Vitest + testing-library setup (vitest.config.ts, src/test/setup.ts)
- GenreGuide React island (mobile-first cards/table, EV scene selector, ISO/ND/FL controls)
- Exposure calculations (astroExposure, handheldExposure) co-located with component
- Genre index page (/genre) and per-genre pages (/genre/[genre])
- GenreScoreBadge.astro static component for mark pips
- ADR-013: curated genre scoring (supersedes ADR-007)

Data model deep review and cleanup:
- Lens: added genreMarks, editorialPicks, reviewSources; merged scoring onto Lens as single source of truth; removed separate GenreLensScore/genreLensScores; moved minFocusDistance to OPTICAL SPECS; created TILT-SHIFT section; renamed hasSmoothFocusRing to hasDampedFocusRing
- Genre: stripped GenreConfig to essentials (removed rule500, minShutter, scoringMethod, benchmarkLens, referenceFl); renamed label to tagline; recommendedFlRange → typicalFl: FlCategory[]; removed dead ScoreResult/ScoreBreakdown types; moved EvScene to common.ts, GenreDefault to component, AstroResult/HandheldResult to exposure.ts
- Camera: all booleans optional (absent=false); FormFactor slr→traditional, dslr-grip→grip; burstFps→mechanicalBurstFps, electronicShutterFps→electronicBurstFps; removed unused FilmSimulation type; added reviewSources
- Accessory: FujiCompatible→MountAccessory (WR removed from mixin); restored isArcaCompatible on PlateAccessory
- Common: added FlCategory, EvScene; renamed CardType→MemoryCardType; removed dead brands (Jaray, Opteka, Sainsonic)
- Review: added ReviewMethodology (lab|field), ReviewTrust (1-3), ReviewSourceInfo; removed editorial tier; removed ReviewLink (unused); removed "other" escape hatch; 16 sources in reviewSourceDirectory (src/data/reviews.ts)
- ADR-012: added wuseria.com/app/io domain candidates

### Session 10 — 2026-04-12

Tool: Claude Code (Opus 4.6)

**Scoring engine, optical data, 9 genre formulas**

Scoring engine (src/utils/scoring.ts):
- Primary floor + weighted average algorithm — primary fields (w=3) set the tier via floor, secondary fields (w=1) rank within tier
- 9 genre formulas: astro, landscape, architecture, portrait, street, travel, sport, wildlife, macro
- Physical property scores: apertureScore, weightScore, magnificationScore — computed from lens specs for genres where they enable/prevent the work
- computeGenreMark / computeAllGenreMarks functions
- 81 tests passing (snapshot tests against real lens data)

Optical quality data — 52 lenses scored:
- LensTip as primary source (trust 3, lab methodology), supplemented by OpticalLimits, Dustin Abbott, ePHOTOzine, Lonely Speck
- 14 optical fields per lens (0-2 scale): center/corner sharpness (stopped/wide open), astigmatism, coma, sphericalAberration, longitudinalCA, lateralCA, distortion, vignetting (wide open/stopped), bokeh, flareResistance
- ADR-014: optical quality rubric with per-field thresholds, sensor-normalized resolution, qualitative word-to-score mapping
- Summary page authority rule: LensTip summary page overrides individual test pages on contradiction
- Audited all 20 original scored lenses against LensTip summary pages, corrected 11 scores
- Samyang 12mm coma upgraded from 1.0 to 1.5 based on multi-source consensus (LensTip + Lonely Speck + Dustin Abbott)
- XF 80mm f/2.8 Macro cornerStopped upgraded from 0.5 to 1.0 (summary PRO: "good image quality on the edge")

Genre formulas validated:
- Astro: coma + astigmatism + apertureScore (lateralCA moved to secondary — correctable in post)
- Landscape: cornerStopped + centerStopped
- Architecture: cornerStopped + centerStopped + distortion
- Portrait: bokeh + centerWideOpen
- Street: centerStopped + apertureScore (zone focusing at f/8 is dominant technique — centerWideOpen secondary)
- Travel: centerStopped + weightScore (weight enables/prevents carrying the lens)
- Sport: centerWideOpen
- Wildlife: centerWideOpen + centerStopped
- Macro: centerStopped + magnificationScore (cornerStopped excluded — infinity test data doesn't reflect macro distances; focusDistance dropped — working distance depends on FL)

Key design decisions:
- FL is never a scoring input (creative choice, shown as filter presets)
- OIS, WR, AF are display attributes, not scoring inputs
- Weight and aperture ARE scoring inputs where they directly enable/prevent the work
- Zooms scored at mid-range FL, not extremes
- Lenses without sufficient optical data excluded from genre results entirely
- genreMarks populated on all 52 scored lenses for build-time access

PRs: #114 (scoring engine), #115 (macro genre integration)
